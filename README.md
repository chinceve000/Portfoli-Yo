This is my portfolio for my **Computer Science 2** class. 
All my work is uploaded through the links below. 

My  work from the first quartile of the 2019/2020 school year is under Quartile 1.
To run my programs, first open the _hello.html_ file. 
In this file, there is a line with "FILE_NAME_HERE"
Replace those words with whichever JavaScript file you'd like to open.
Download the JavaScript file and then run the _hello.html_ file.

My work from the second quartile from of the 2019/2020 school year is under Quartile 2.
To run my programs, first open the _run.html_ file. 
In this file, there is a line with "FILE_NAME_HERE"
Replace those words with whichever JavaScript file you'd like to open.
Download the JavaScript file and then run the _run.html_ file. 

My work from the third quartile of the 2019/2020 school year is under Quartile 3. 
This nine weeks, we focused on D3 and data visualization. 
You can run my files through the _d3.html_ file. 
Replace the name of the current js file running with the name of the file you're running.
Download the js file and have fun! _idk.html_ does not need to be run through the _d3.html_ file. 

At my high school, all sophomores must complete the Personal Project: an opportunity for students to create something in a topic they're interested in, following IB guidelines. I chose to create a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript teaching users the basis of Python. I put a lot of time and effort into completing the project, so I highly recommend you click that HTML file pp.html! By the way, the pp stands for Personal Project.
