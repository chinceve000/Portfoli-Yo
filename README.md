# Portfoli-Yo
This is my portfolio for my **Computer Science 2** class. 
All my work is uploaded in the files section. 
To run my programs, first open the _hello.html_ file. 
In this file, there is a line with "CHANGE FILE NAME?"
Replace those words with whichever JavaScript file you'd like to open.
Download the JavaScript file and then run the _hello.html_ file.
